    Function input:
    n_samples: number of samples to create.
    Function returns:
    X: Two features for each sample.
       It is a matrix of dimensions: n_samples x 2
    class_labels: Class of each sample. Vector of dims: n_samples x 1
                  It has value 1 for Class-1, 2 for Class-2.

    For each class, same number of samples is returned from each of the
    corresponding Gaussians.
